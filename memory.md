# Project memory — Embroidery Billing SaaS

Read this before making changes. It captures architecture, conventions, and
decisions from Phases 1–10 so future work stays consistent instead of
re-deriving (or accidentally contradicting) what's already here.

## What this is

A multi-tenant embroidery billing SaaS: companies manage customers,
configurable embroidery categories/formulas, invoices, and a customer ledger.
Built incrementally, one numbered phase per request, each phase extending
the previous rather than rebuilding it.

## Stack & layout

npm workspaces monorepo:

```
apps/api/       Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL (pg)
apps/web/       React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 (Vite)
packages/shared/  Types + the formula engine, used by both apps
```

- `apps/api/src/modules/<name>/` — one folder per domain (auth, company,
  customers, formulas, invoices, ledger), each with `*.service.ts` (DB
  logic) and `*.routes.ts` (Express router, mounted in `app.ts`).
- `apps/api/src/migrations/*.sql` — numbered, applied in order by
  `src/db/migrate.ts` on boot (also `npm run migrate -w @invoice/api`).
  Migrations are wrapped in a Postgres advisory lock so concurrent
  processes (parallel tests, multiple API instances) can't race to apply
  the same one twice.
- `apps/web/src/features/<name>/` — mirrors the api modules; each has
  `api.ts` (fetch wrappers) + components. `App.tsx` is a tab-based
  single-card dashboard (Overview / Customers / Categories / Invoices).
- `packages/shared/src/` — `entities.ts` (all shared types), `api.ts`
  (`ApiErrorBody`), `formula-engine/` (moved here in Phase 9 so the
  frontend's live preview uses the *exact* server calculation code).

Root scripts (`package.json`): `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, `test` all run
across workspaces in dependency order (shared → api/web). `test` builds
`@invoice/shared` first since `apps/api` imports its compiled `dist/`.

## Core architectural rules (established Phase 1, held throughout)

1. **Tenant isolation**: every company-scoped query is filtered by
   `companyId` taken from `auth(req).companyId` (resolved server-side from
   the session), **never** from the request body/URL/params. Cross-tenant
   access returns 404, not 403 (existence isn't leaked). This is tested
   explicitly in every module's test file.
2. **Money/decimals**: `pg` type parser overrides NUMERIC (OID 1700) and
   DATE (OID 1082) to return plain strings — never floats, never
   timezone-shifted `Date` objects (`apps/api/src/db/pool.ts`). All money
   arithmetic goes through `decimal.js` (`Decimal`, `roundMoney()` from
   `@invoice/shared`). Validation regexes live in `apps/api/src/lib/validate.ts`
   (`optionalMoney`, `requirePositiveDecimal`, etc.) and always keep the
   value as a string.
3. **No hard-coded business data**: embroidery categories and formulas are
   entirely company-configured data (`embroidery_categories` table,
   `formula_config` jsonb). The example categories/formulas from product
   briefs (HS/HP, Daman, Patti, Bazu, Dupatta) are never hard-coded into
   logic — only used as example/test fixtures.
4. **Snapshots, not live joins**: `invoice_items` stores `category_name`,
   `rate`, `formula_type`, `formula_config`, `calculation_inputs`,
   `calculated_unit_amount`, `calculated_total` all as a point-in-time copy.
   Editing a category later never changes an already-saved invoice — tested
   explicitly (`snapshots survive later changes...`).
5. **Ledger is the source of truth for balances**: nothing stores a
   "current balance" column anywhere. `ledger_entries` is append-only
   (never UPDATE/DELETE); balance = `SUM(debit) - SUM(credit)`, always
   computed fresh. A customer's `opening_balance` column is just the input
   that seeded one `OPENING_BALANCE` ledger row at creation — it's
   immutable after that (removed from `CustomerPatch` in Phase 8).
6. **Auth/session**: httpOnly, `SameSite=Lax` cookie holding a session
   token (only its SHA-256 hash is stored). `requireAuth` joins
   `sessions` → `company_members` so a revoked membership invalidates the
   session immediately. `requireRole('owner','admin')` gates
   company-settings endpoints; customers/categories/invoices are editable
   by any authenticated member (owner/admin/staff) since they're
   operational data entry.
7. **Formula engine, no eval()**: `packages/shared/src/formula-engine/` is
   a hand-written recursive-descent parser (tokenizer → parser → AST →
   evaluator) over a fixed variable allow-list (`stitches`, `rate`,
   `factor`, `multiplier`, `divisor`, `quantity`). Category convention:
   `formula_config.expression` holds the formula text; any other
   numeric/string key in `formula_config` is a fixed input value (e.g. a
   baked-in multiplier). New formula "types" are just new expression
   strings — no code change needed.
8. **Invoice numbering**: `invoice_counters` table, one row per company.
   `UPDATE ... SET next_number = next_number + 1 RETURNING next_number - 1`
   inside the invoice-creation transaction — the row lock serializes
   concurrent creations safely. Format: `{company.invoicePrefix}-000001`.

## Module map (what exists, what it does)

| Module | Backend routes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| auth | `/api/auth/{register,login,logout,me}` | scrypt password hashing, generic errors |
| companies | `/api/companies` (list/create/switch) | multi-company membership, switches session's active tenant |
| company | `/api/company`, `/api/company/logo` | full profile (Phase 3): factory name, logo, contact, invoice prefix/currency/**defaultInvoiceTemplate**/terms. Logo storage behind `LogoStorage` interface (`apps/api/src/lib/storage/`) — local disk today, swappable later |
| customers | `/api/customers` | CRUD + search + archive (soft, never deleted) |
| formulas (categories) | `/api/categories` | CRUD + enable/disable (soft); `formula_type` free text, `formula_config` jsonb |
| invoices | `/api/invoices` | create (all calc server-side)/list/view only — **no PATCH/edit**, by design |
| ledger | `/api/customers/:customerId/ledger`, `.../payments`, `.../adjustments` | view ledger+balance, record a payment (credit) or adjustment (exactly one of debit/credit) |

Frontend: `apps/web/src/features/invoices/templates/` (Phase 10) — 5
selectable print-friendly invoice designs (Classic Navy, Modern Curve,
Minimal Clean, Industrial Blue, Premium Modern), all rendering the same
`InvoiceViewModel` (deliberately excludes formula/factor/multiplier/divisor
— enforced by the type shape, not just by convention). Registry-based:
add a template = one new component + one registry line, no backend
changes. Default template is chosen per-company via the Company Profile
form's select (`CompanyProfile.defaultInvoiceTemplate`, stored as a plain
string, no DB enum — so new templates never need a migration).

## Known gotchas / things to check before starting work

- **Postgres cluster is often stopped** when a session starts:
  `pg_lsclusters` then `pg_ctlcluster 16 main start` if down. Dev DB
  `embroidery`, test DB `embroidery_test`, both owned by role `app`.
- **`npm test` at root** runs `@invoice/shared`'s tests, builds it, then
  runs `@invoice/api`'s tests (which imports the built shared package) —
  don't run `npm run test -w @invoice/api` alone without building shared
  first if shared changed.
- **Always run the full check sequence** after changes:
  `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build && npm test` (all
  from repo root). Every phase so far has ended with all of these green
  plus a live curl or Playwright smoke test against the built app.
- **`decimal.js` import**: must be `import { Decimal } from 'decimal.js'`
  (named import), not `import Decimal from 'decimal.js'` — the default
  import breaks under this repo's `NodeNext` + `esModuleInterop` tsconfig
  (`Cannot use namespace 'Decimal' as a type`).
- **CompanyProfileForm bug (fixed Phase 10)**: frontend forms that PATCH
  a partial-update endpoint must omit untouched blank fields, not send
  `""` — the backend's `optionalString` validators treat a
  present-but-empty string as "set this to empty" and reject it against
  min-length validation.
- **`requireJsonForMutations` middleware** (`apps/api/src/middleware/errors.ts`)
  allows `application/json` and `multipart/form-data` (needed for logo
  upload) for state-changing requests — relies on `SameSite=Lax` cookies
  for CSRF protection, not a `Content-Type` check alone.
- Build artifacts (`dist/`, `apps/api/uploads/`) are gitignored and get
  cleaned up after smoke tests — don't commit them.

## Testing conventions

- `node:test` + `supertest`, one file per module in `apps/api/test/`
  (`auth.test.ts`, `customers.test.ts`, `categories.test.ts`,
  `invoices.test.ts`, `ledger.test.ts`, `tenant-isolation.test.ts`,
  `company-profile.test.ts`) and `packages/shared/test/formula-engine.test.ts`.
- Every module's tests include an explicit tenant-isolation case (cross-
  company access → 404) and, where relevant, a snapshot-immutability case.
- Real bugs have been found by writing these tests before assuming
  something works (migration race condition, decimal type-inference bug
  in `COALESCE($n, 0)`, ledger tenant-isolation leak, the profile-form
  blank-field bug above) — keep writing tests that actually exercise
  concurrency/edge cases, not just the happy path.
- Browser smoke tests use Playwright installed ad-hoc into `/tmp` (not a
  project dependency) against the built app + a running Postgres, with
  screenshots saved to `/tmp` and cleaned up after.

## Phase history (chronological)

1. Foundation: users/companies/company_members/sessions, session cookie auth
2. Multi-company membership: `/api/companies` list/create/switch
3. Company profile: full profile fields, logo upload (storage abstraction)
4. Customer module: CRUD, search, archive; opening_balance (decimal)
5. Embroidery categories: configurable name/rate/formula_type/formula_config
6. Formula engine: safe expression parser/evaluator, no eval(), decimal-safe
7. Invoice core: create/view/list, snapshots, safe per-company numbering
8. Customer ledger: OPENING_BALANCE/INVOICE/PAYMENT/ADJUSTMENT entries,
   balance always derived, invoice ledger-summary fields
9. Invoice creation UI: single-page form, live client-side preview
   (moved formula engine to `packages/shared` for this), keyboard-friendly
10. Invoice template engine: 5 selectable print designs, registry-based,
    default per company

Repo also went through a monorepo restructure (`server/` → `apps/api` +
new `apps/web` + `packages/shared`) between Phase 1 and Phase 2.

## Not yet built (candidates for future phases)

- PDF export beyond the browser's native print-to-PDF
- Payments/expenses as their own module (currently only ledger PAYMENT
  entries exist, recorded from the customer ledger panel)
- Invoice editing/cancellation (only create/view/list exist, by design —
  revisit only if explicitly requested)
- Reporting/dashboards, machines/production tracking (mentioned in the
  original product brief as later-phase modules)
